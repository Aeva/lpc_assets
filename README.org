The Liberated Pixel Cup - Asset Library
.

This module is a curated collection of LPC assets and keyframe files
for easy animation and custimization.  It is organized so that it can
be easily included into other projects but maintained separately.

It was designed with [https://github.com/Aeva/m.grl](m.grl) in mind,
but may just as well be used elsewhere.

Like the LPC base set itself, the art assets in this repository are
available to you both under the General Public License (version 3) and
the Creative Commons Attribution Share-Alike License (version 3.0).
