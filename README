The Liberated Pixel Cup - Asset Library
.


This module is a curated collection of LPC assets and keyframe files
for easy animation and custimization.  It is organized so that it can
be easily included into other projects but maintained separately.

It was designed with https://github.com/Aeva/m.grl in mind,
but may just as well be used elsewhere.

Like the LPC base set itself, the art assets in this repository are
available to you both under the General Public License (version 3) and
the Creative Commons Attribution Share-Alike License (version 3.0).

The keyframe files define sprite offsets for animation.  The advantage
of these files is that when sprites are properly formatted, they can
be swapped out for other sprites with similar formatting.  In
something like the original LPC characters, if you were to add a new
animation, all of the sprite sheets would need to be re-worked to show
the new animation.  Keyframe files can be used to avoid this problem.
If you're confused, take a look at this demo:

.


The sprite offsets for head and hair graphics are pretty much final,
and I'll happily accept new contributions in those categories.  The
current layout of bodies/outfits is NOT final, and will be re-worked
in the near future to be better to use with keyframe files.  Outfits
will not be "baked" on to body sprites in the future, but I've yet to
decide how best to do this.
.


This file also contains a python script for converting sprites from
the Universal Sprite Sheet's format to this repository's preferred
layout.  The script is found in the "scripts" folder, and other useful
programs may appear there in the future.  In the present moment, it
only has a command line interface, and learning how to use it is left
as an exercise to the reader.
